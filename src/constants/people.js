I got 5.\" And he said, \"What?\" and was talking to me very disrespectfully and threw in the word \"dumb\" or something. I was just like, \"Are you not going to tell me how to do it?\" I don't know, it was just very disheartening. I kind of just left office hours, but it gave me a really bad impression of the department and the students in the department."],

    quotes: ["This isn't necessarily only specific to CS but to academics in general at Harvard, that if you need help on a problem set or if you are stuck on understanding some concept you're expected to constantly go to office hours or find study groups. And that's not always possible for disabled people because personally, I have a medical schedule. I have other schedules related to my disability that I have to follow...That kind of bars me from going to office hours anytime I want to go. Not to mention that office hours aren't always in accessible locations or they're in places where the elevator randomly breaks and no one knows about it or they're just far away on campus and by the time I get there office hours will be over.

And so for me, when we talk about climate change in ESE, there's the very scientific perspective of: this is how greenhouse gases are warming the planet. But it's then helpful as a Black man to be able to put that conversation in the context of discussing communities that will continue to be overburdened if we continue this path. If we talk about chemical contaminants and drinking water, I can bring the perspective of talking very clearly using my background in terms of how that's going to impact certain communities disproportionately."],
