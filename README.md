## How to contribute

### Create a new branch for each feature you develop
To create a branch callsed `mk-navigation`, run `git checkout -b mk-navigation`. Name branches in the format `initials-featurename`.

### Make commits on your branch whenever you want to save your progress.
* `git add .` adds all of the changed files in the directory to be staged.
* `git commit -m "Add person representation"` commits those changed files as part of your version history.
* `git push` pushes those changed files to your branch in the cloud.

Make sure you always pull before your push! That means that your code will always reflect the most recent changes from `main`, and you'll decrease your chances of having to deal with nasty merge conflicts.

### When you're ready to incorporate your changes into the `main` branch, make a pull request (PR) on Github!
